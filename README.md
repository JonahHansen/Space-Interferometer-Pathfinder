# OrbitDynamics
Jonah Honours Project on Orbital Dynamics

Files:
plotter1 - your original code
plotter2 - Messed around with the rotations, though it doesn't keep phase
plotter3 - Using the intersecting plane idea to find the deputy orbits
plotter4 - Numerically finding the orbit using the intersecting plane
plotter5 - Same as the original, but using quaternions instead of matrices (same result, but slower and easier to use)

quaternions.py: helper functions for quaternion rotation
